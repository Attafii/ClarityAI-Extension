# Icon for Clarity Extension

## Current Status
A placeholder icon.svg has been created. You need to:

1. **Convert to PNG**: Use any online converter or image editor to convert `icon.svg` to `icon.png` at 128×128 pixels
2. **Design Guidelines**:
   - 128×128 pixels (required for VS Code Marketplace)
   - Clear, recognizable symbol
   - Good contrast for both light and dark themes
   - Represents "clarity" or "enhancement" concept

## Suggested Icon Concepts
- 🔍 Magnifying glass (clarity/improvement)
- ✨ Sparkles (enhancement/magic)
- 📝 Document with checkmark (improved writing)
- 🎯 Target (precision/clarity)
- 💡 Light bulb (insight/clarity)

## Current Icon
The current `icon.svg` uses a simple clarity/enhancement theme with sparkles and text improvement symbols.

## How to Replace
1. Create your 128×128 PNG icon
2. Save as `icon.png` in the root directory
3. The `package.json` already references `"icon": "icon.png"`
